There's no single "best" story in English, as the best story is subjective and depends on individual preferences and the purpose for reading. However, some popular and widely acclaimed short stories in English include "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson, "The Garden Party" by Katherine Mansfield, and "Hills Like White Elephants" by Ernest Hemingway.
